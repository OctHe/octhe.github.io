## Shell

Sometimes we have a network problem in shell.
When this happens, it is recommended to set a proxy for the terminal.
The proxy can be set with the following command in the `~/.zshrc` file (suppose the shell is `zsh`).

    export http_proxy="socks5://127.0.0.1:7890"
    export https_proxy="socks5://127.0.0.1:7890"


## git

`git can be installed by

    sudo apt install git 

We can set a sock5 proxy with the following command

    git config --global http.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:8088' 
    git config --global https.proxy 'socks5://127.0.0.1:8088'
